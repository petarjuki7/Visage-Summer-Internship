# Visage-Summer-Internship
Summer Computer Vision internship at Visage Technologies

Models were trained with images from the TuSimple dataset (https://github.com/TuSimple/tusimple-benchmark).

In the Model_Report notebook there is a comparison between different models, with or without dataset expansion with augmented images.

In the picture_pipeline_example notebook is an example of going from just the raw image to detected lanes and each of the lanes classified.

The training_aug and training_classes files contain the scripts used for dataset loading and model training.
